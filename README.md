# 🏦 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning techniques in R**. By leveraging classification models like **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees**, we aim to identify fraudulent transactions effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** ranger, caret, data.table, caTools, pROC, rpart, rpart.plot
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## 🔍 Key Features
✔️ Data preprocessing and normalization for better model accuracy.  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including statistical insights.  
✔️ Implementation of **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees** for classification.  
✔️ **ROC Curve Analysis** for model evaluation.  
✔️ Fraud detection with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression:** Achieved a good trade-off between precision and recall.
- **Decision Tree:** Provided interpretability with visual decision boundaries.
- **ROC Curve Analysis:** Evaluated the models based on AUC scores.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("ranger", "caret", "data.table", "caTools", "pROC", "rpart", "rpart.plot"))
   ```
2. Load the dataset in R.
3. Run the script to train and evaluate the models.
